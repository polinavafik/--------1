# JavaScript-TimeMeasure

A website that allows users to measure the time between dates, using different measure units.

The front-end part of the application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The layout is pretty simple, so it would look the same using either a computer or a phone. 

Users cannot put an End date, unless there is a Start date, and the End date cannot be prior to the Start date. There are two presets present on the site - 1 week and 1 month. Further down there is a Special option block, where users can choose to calculate All days, Only weekdays, or Only weekends. And right before the calculate button, there is a Time Dimension block, where users can choose between seconds, minutes, hours, and days.

ðŸŽˆFun Fact - when the user puts their mouse on the Time Dimension block, a short audio is played. It's a fragment of Vecna's (from Stranger Things) speech, where he lists all possible time dimensions. That's why the user has some "blocked" options on that list - weeks, months, years, decades.

In this project, the data is saved in the browser's local storage. This means that any data entered by the user will be saved and can be retrieved the next time the user visits the website.

Additionally, the user can see a table with the last 10 results, and the dates that they've entered into the time measurement tool. This provides a convenient way for users to keep track of their previous measurements and compare them over time.

My favorite creation so farðŸŒ¹
